Cyberlimb system observations

- Some augments give situational bonuses to tests. This needs to get reflected in the dice pool system
- Some augments (e.g. analysis units) give other augments for free
- Some augs span several categories (e.g. datajacks are headware but can be installed in limbs)
- Some augs confer armor, hardened or otherwise, and that isn't in the program yet
- Some augs (e.g. pain inhibitor) modify tests that don't depend on anything currently tracked in the app (in this case, wound modifiers, which can't be determined from a character sheet since they only come up during play)
- IP is not yet in the game. Oops.
- Cyber torso and skull give ESS discounts on things installed within them.
- Some augs allow free text entry (cosmetic modification -- should this even be implemented?)
- Building custom cyberware still needs to be possible and custom
- Need to track items that have been added to all limbs together to enforce limits on "can be taken once per full limb"
- Some qualities affect essence cost
- Some augs may be bundles of bundles (SimStar(TM)) and bonuses don't stack
