# sr4x-chargen
Character generator for Shadowrun 4x

## INTRODUCTION
SR4X isn't my idea. It's a heavily house-modded version of Shadowrun 4th Edition,
specifically the ruleset articulated in the 20th anniversary source book.
Modifications to these rules were devised by my cousin and one of his acquaintances, and we have
a more mathematically-coherent game system as a result.

## DISTINCTIVES
Most parts of the rules have been modified in some way, but this tool only
concerns itself with the components relevant to character generation (henceforth chargen).
Specifically, changes to base attributes, quality/skill costs, skill categories,
cyberware function/cost, and a grab bag of other tweaks are in scope here. A few
deviations from the published rules to note:
* All characters start with their racial average in each attribute.
* Characters now start with 200BP by default, but this is configurable in the tool.
* The cost for playing a non-human metatype has been equalized. Some stats have
been re-balanced to accommodate this.
* Skill groups have been shifted around, and skills now cost less.
* It is now possible to create effect-based cyberware rather than simply choosing
from a list of pre-defined augmentations.

## CAVEATS
SR4X rules are still in flux, so there are a few items to watch out for:
* Technomancer rules are still being re-written. As such, the tool does not support
building Technomancers at this time.
* Cost for matrix gear may be subject to change.
* A major update to the magic rules system is incoming, so the formulae and costs for
spells and foci may also be subject to change.

## MISC
Feel free to use/modify the tool as needed for your table. If you re-publish it
with your modifications, a link to the original would be nice, but you don't have to.
If you encounter any problems, feel free to open an issue on the repo.
